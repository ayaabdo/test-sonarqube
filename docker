Docker

1- What are containers?

completely isolated env, their own process or services and their own network interface and all share the same os kernel

os kernel is reposible for interacting with the underlying hw

the main purpose of docker is to package and containerize app and to ship them and run them anywhere any time as many times as you want 
docker containers takes minutes to boot up
whereas VMs take time as it boot up the entire system 
2- What is docker ?
3- Why do you need it ?

set up end to end all stack, we need to set up diff services 
the compatibility with the underlying os was an issue we have to ensure that all this services were compatible the os version 
the compatibility between these services and the libraries and dependencies on the os 
one service requires one version of a dependent library whereas another service requires another version
app version changes over time 
long setup time - diff env 
we can't guarantee that the app that we are building will run the same way in diff anv
we need something that allow us to change the components without affecting the other components and even modify the underlying system as required 
 
4- What can it do ?
with docker we run each component in a seperate container with its own dependencies and its own lib 
5- Run docker containers
6- Create a Docker image
